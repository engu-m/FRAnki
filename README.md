# FRAnki üá´üá∑üìù

Learn the meaning of unknown **FR**ench words you have encountered with **Anki**!

Read the full blog post explaining what this repo is about [here](https://engu-m.github.io).

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the requirements, with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (`python >= 3.9`). It may also require Firefox.

## Usage

To start with your own (french) words, edit the file `mots nouveaux.txt` with your own words then run `main.py`. This should update `Voc_FR.apkg` which you can import to Anki Desktop.

## Handling failure cases

If the word you are asking for does not exist on the CNRTL (such as the german word Streichholzsch√§chtelchen), it will be added to the list of unknown words under `data/mots non trouv√©s.txt` so that you can manually look for it and add it to anki.

The web scraper cannot retrieve multiple meanings ; only the first one is saved.
